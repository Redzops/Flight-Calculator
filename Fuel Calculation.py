# Step 1: Assign Variables
speed_knots = 120  # Example: cruising speed in knots
time_hours = 2     # Example: duration of the flight in hours

# Step 2: Calculate Distance
distance_nm = speed_knots * time_hours

# Step 3: Display Result
print("The total distance traveled during the flight is:", distance_nm, "nautical miles")
